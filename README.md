# Forecasting European Index Trends: A Comparative Study of Classical and Machine Learning Models
Capstone Project

**Project Overview**
This repository contains the capstone project titled "Forecasting European Index Trends: A Comparative Study of Classical and Machine Learning Models." The project aims to explore, develop, and compare both traditional time series models (such as ARIMA and AutoARIMA) and machine learning models (like LSTM) for forecasting stock market trends in Europe, using various economic indicators.

**Research Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of both traditional time series forecasting models and machine learning models in predicting trends in European stock indices. The study compares classical models (ARIMA, AutoARIMA) with deep learning techniques (LSTM) to assess the impact of key economic indicators like interest rates, inflation, and bond yields on stock market movements.

**Repository Structure**
Data Collection: Contains scripts and datasets used to collect historical stock market and economic indicator data (such as interest rates, inflation, and bond yields).
Data Preprocessing: Code for data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, and preparing the data for the models.
Model Development________
ARIMA and AutoARIMA Models: Classical time series models used for univariate forecasting.
LSTM Model: A machine learning-based neural network for multivariate forecasting using sequential data.
Model Tuning and Hyperparameter Optimization: Code for model optimization to improve performance.
Analysis: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts containing model evaluations, comparison of results, and interpretations.
Visualizations: Graphs and charts showcasing stock market forecasts, model performance comparisons, and insights into how different economic factors influence stock trends.
Documentation: Detailed documentation covering the methodology, data sources, model configurations, and analysis.

**Research Methodology**
The project employs the following structured approach:
Literature Review: A thorough review of the existing methodologies for stock market prediction using both classical and machine learning techniques.
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Historical data on stock indices and relevant economic indicators are gathered and processed to ensure clean, normalized datasets.
Model Development________
ARIMA: Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average, a traditional time series forecasting method.
AutoARIMA: An automated version of ARIMA that selects optimal model parameters.
LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory Networks, a deep learning model that captures long-term dependencies in sequential data.
Analysis and Interpretation: The results from the ARIMA, AutoARIMA, and LSTM models are compared in terms of forecast accuracy (RMSE, MAPE, RÂ²). Model outputs are analyzed to identify trends and interpret the influence of different economic indicators.
Documentation and Reporting: Comprehensive documentation of methods, results, and conclusions.

**Ethical Considerations**
Ethical and responsible data handling is a cornerstone of this project. All data sources are acknowledged, personal data is anonymized, and privacy regulations are strictly followed.
